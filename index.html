            Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
            to
            the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
            shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
            of the ones that became nothing.

            Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
            how
            you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
            friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
            called me Mr Glass.

            Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw
            Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to
            me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

            Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name
            printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
            mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
            And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.

            go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that
            bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm
